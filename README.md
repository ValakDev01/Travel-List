# Travel List Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a React-based packing list application that enables users to efficiently manage their packing items. It features a central App component responsible for maintaining the state of the packing list, including functions to add new items, delete existing ones, toggle their packed status, and clear the entire list.

Users interact with the application through a Form component, where they can input item descriptions and quantities. The PackingList component displays these items, with options to sort them by input order, description, or packed status. Each item is managed by the Item component, which provides functionality to toggle the item's packed status or delete it.

Additionally, the Stats component offers a summary of the packing progress, showing the total number of items, the number of packed items, and the packing percentage. This comprehensive setup helps users stay organized and track their packing progress efficiently.
